# spherical_motor_project
Data-driven approaches for control such as using NNs, are feasible solutions for modeling and control of complex nonlinear dynamical systems. A multivariable PID controller for the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Spherical Motor(PMSSM) was implemented by a past graduate student, however, this controller lacked robustness, and it is unable to account for essential nonlinearities provided by the Hudson bearings as well as uncertainties. The step response and time-varying reference trajectory using this controller resulted in large overshoot and large tracking error respectively. 
The main motivation for the work presented here is to design an improved or intelligent control system using Artificial Neural Networks that better models the non-linearities of the system. The problem at hand is a servo problem to make the output follow the desired reference trajectory.
The research for this project is on using feedforward or recurrent neural networks for modeling and control of a 3DOF PMSSM. The literature will present model structure, data collection, and system identification for non-linear systems in great detail. This paper will also show the attempts made to design non-linear controllers using NNs.
